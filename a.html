    <p class="w3-justify">Hackergirl’s Hackathon Program is designed to encourage learners to achieve their full potential through 6 Future-Ready Competencies. Learning to code and making a difference through technology goes beyond programming knowledge and skills. That’s why these core competencies equip girls with the ability to meet the complex demands of diverse contexts and be successful in their everyday lives and in their future.

        We believe that every girl can thrive when they are given the opportunity to tell their story and share their voice. We want to champion them along the way!</p>

  <h5>Despite the overwhelming interest in computer science by girls in lower stages of school, only a fraction continue to graduate in a relevant discipline. With Computer Science jobs predicted to be the highest-paying sector over the next decade (paying almost $15,000 more than average) young, tech-savvy girls are missing out.

    But, with National Coding Week kicking off last Monday bigger and better than ever before, it is important to recognise the success of female programmers and reassert their importance to the industry. As the sector becomes more central to the world economy, it is essential more women are inspired and enabled to be part of it.
    
    Despite the frequent misconception that coding is a jargon-fuelled, complicated amass of numbers, programming is “one of the most prestigious and well-paid careers that you can teach yourself entirely online and with nearly no financial resources” according to Glamour.
    
    Matter Of Form had a conversation with Lara Inskip, a Full Stack software developer from Washington, who stumbled across coding following a degree in History. After chatting with her father about HTML, she found herself inspired to complete a Makers Academy course for programming. She has since worked on an incredible range of digital consultancy, from client-based projects with Waitrose to her own audiohistory project. She has had “a hugely positive experience”. However, whilst the tech industry is largely progressive, Lara acknowledged “the real lack of female tech leads”. Girls are clearly lacking essential inspiration that cements and progresses career choices.</h5>
  <br>
<h6>Sociologists have said women are less likely to be “crackers” — dark-side hackers who illegally break into systems to vandalize them — than the average male.

  British sociologist Paul Taylor and MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle have spun theories from the Freudian (crackers have a masculine desire to ‘penetrate’ into an unwilling system) to the sociological (men seek ‘hard mastery’ over abstract systems while women seek ‘soft mastery’ over social situations.)
  
  Jane Del Favero, the network security manager at New York University, has read the riot act to plenty of students caught for breaking into machines. Not one of them has been female.
  
  “I’m not sure if there is much about hacking that attracts the average teenage girl. My impression is that they’re not interested in the pointless glory of defacing a Web site,” she said.
  
  The girls do say they’re a bit different from the guys. Chainsawkitten, a 21-year-old woman from Spokane, Wash. isn’t into the traditional long-term hacking sessions in front of a terminal with a bottle of Jolt Cola; she prefers a more balanced life.
  
  “I just get a little stir crazy at times. My eyes start to hurt, and I get a headache. So it definitely helps to get out,” she said.</h6>

<br><br><br><p>Female hackers do exist. (PhotoDisc)

  But female hackers do exist. <br> They are queens of pirated software, anti-child-porn crusaders, political activists and leaders of private online vendettas. ABCNEWS.com spoke to more than a dozen of them from the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Part of an underground society which often has the misogynistic stink of a high school boys’ locker room, these tough women show the guys they can match their game. A note about names: Like most hackers, these women choose to go by online handles. Real names will be noted as such.</p>
<br><p>Growing Up Hacking

  Many women got into hacking in their late teens. Condemned.org’s Blueberry had never touched a computer before she bought one for her daughter; Blueberry was 29 at the time. And Courtnee said she’s been a hacker almost since birth.
  
  “Don’t get me wrong, I still had ‘My Little Ponies’ and played with makeup. But I’m the only girl I know who constantly tore apart her father’s calculators and old electronics at kindergarten age,” Courtnee said.
  
  Colleen Card, who used to edit a newsletter for phone phreaks (people who hack the telephone system), got into the scene through her husband. Retired from phreaking at 22 and living in the St. Louis area, Colleen is now raising a 21st-century techie girl, she says.
  
  “My daughter is 4. She’s really into computers; she’s been able to operate a mouse since she was 2,” she said.
